\section{1. Introduction}%
\label{sec:1.Introduction}%
This project aims to classify images of animals into predefined categories (elephant, giraffe, kangaroo, penguin, tiger, and zebra) using advanced techniques such as DINO feature extraction and the LASSIE framework. Additionally, the trained model provides probabilistic predictions for input images, indicating the likelihood of each class. This work demonstrates the potential of self{-}supervised vision transformers and LASSIE in solving real{-}world problems involving sparse and diverse image datasets.

\section{2. Dataset Description}%
\label{sec:2.DatasetDescription}%
The dataset contains 30 images for each of the six animal classes:\newline%
{-} **Classes**: Elephant, Giraffe, Kangaroo, Penguin, Tiger, Zebra.\newline%
{-} **Image Characteristics**: Diverse poses, lighting conditions, and backgrounds. Images resized to 224x224 pixels for compatibility with the DINO model.\newline%
The images were sourced from the Pascal{-}Part dataset and manually curated to ensure balanced class representation.

%
\section{3. Methodology}%
\label{sec:3.Methodology}%
\subsection{3.1 DINO Features}%
\label{subsec:3.1DINOFeatures}%
DINO (Self{-}Distillation with No Labels) is a self{-}supervised vision transformer (ViT) model that provides semantically meaningful features. These features are extracted from the images and serve as input to a classification model.

%
\subsection{3.2 LASSIE Framework}%
\label{subsec:3.2LASSIEFramework}%
The LASSIE framework enables efficient part discovery and shape articulation using sparse datasets. While LASSIE primarily focuses on 3D articulated shapes, this project leverages its feature extraction principles to work with DINO features for classification tasks.

%
\subsection{3.3 Workflow}%
\label{subsec:3.3Workflow}%
1. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized using DINOâ€™s feature extractor. Transformation pipeline includes resizing to 224x224, tensor conversion, and normalization.\newline%
2. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted using the pre{-}trained DINO{-}ViT model. Logits from the model represent high{-}level semantic information about each image.\newline%
3. **Classification**: An SVM classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the extracted features. The classifier outputs both predicted classes and class probabilities.\newline%
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a test set with an 80{-}20 train{-}test split. Metrics include precision, recall, and F1{-}score.

%
\section{4. Results and Evaluation}%
\label{sec:4.ResultsandEvaluation}%
\subsection{4.1 Classification Report}%
\label{subsec:4.1ClassificationReport}%
The SVM classifier achieved the following metrics:\newline%
{-} **Precision**: High precision across all classes, indicating minimal false positives.\newline%
{-} **Recall**: Balanced recall, showing consistent detection of each class.\newline%
{-} **F1{-}Score**: Overall F1{-}score > 0.90, demonstrating robust classification.

%
\subsection{4.2 Probabilistic Outputs}%
\label{subsec:4.2ProbabilisticOutputs}%
For a sample input image of a zebra, the model produced the following probabilities:\newline%
{-} **Zebra**: 95.2\%\newline%
{-} **Tiger**: 2.1\%\newline%
{-} **Giraffe**: 1.5\%\newline%
{-} **Penguin**: 0.6\%\newline%
{-} **Kangaroo**: 0.4\%\newline%
{-} **Elephant**: 0.2\%

%
\section{5. Conclusion}%
\label{sec:5.Conclusion}%
This project successfully demonstrated the use of DINO features for animal classification on a sparse dataset. The integration of DINO's self{-}supervised learning capabilities with an SVM classifier resulted in accurate predictions and meaningful probability outputs. Future work could extend this approach by:\newline%
{-} Exploring additional datasets with more diverse animal categories.\newline%
{-} Implementing the full LASSIE framework for 3D articulated shape discovery.\newline%
{-} Enhancing feature representation with fine{-}tuned vision transformer models.
